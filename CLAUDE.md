# Global Rules

This file contains the global rules and principles that never change and should be followed consistently.

## 🔄 Core Principles

**IMPORTANT: These principles apply to ALL work:**

### Framework Workflow

- **Always start with INITIAL.md**
- **Create a list of small tasks to complete the TASK**
- **Select proper agent for each small task**
- **Execution** - Before complete each small task read carefully the documentation, patterns, examples on the specific task_agent file.

### Research Methodology

- **Web search first** - Always do extensive web research before implementation
- **Documentation deep dive** - Study official docs, best practices, and common patterns
- **Pattern extraction** - Identify reusable patterns and architectural conventions
- **Gotcha documentation** - Document common pitfalls and edge cases

## 📚 Project Awareness & Context

- **Use consistent naming conventions** and file structure patterns
- **Follow established directory organization patterns**
- **Leverage examples extensively** - Study existing patterns before creating new ones

## 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity

- **Never create files longer than 500 lines** - Split into modules when approaching limit
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules** grouped by feature or responsibility
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages)
- **Follow established coding standards and conventions**

## ✅ Task Management

- **Break complex tasks into smaller steps** with clear completion criteria
- **Mark tasks complete immediately** after finishing them
- **Update task status in real-time** as work progresses

## 📎 Documentation Standards

- **Write comprehensive documentation** for every component
- **Include clear usage examples** with working code
- **Document all gotchas and edge cases** to prevent common errors
- **Maintain up-to-date references** to external documentation

## 🔍 Research Standards

- **Web search is your best friend** - Use it extensively for technology research
- **Study official documentation thoroughly** before implementation
- **Research established patterns** and best practices for the technology
- **Document all findings comprehensively** in PRPs and implementation guides

## 🎯 Implementation Standards

- **Follow the PRP workflow religiously** - Don't skip steps
- **Always validate before proceeding** to the next step
- **Use existing patterns as templates** rather than creating from scratch
- **Include comprehensive error handling** in all implementations
- **Ask before start a new pattern not documented yet** - Make a list of yes/no questions in a ordened list (1, 2, 3, etc) and wait for response such as (NO, YES, YES, etc)

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Always Avoid

- ❌ Don't skip research - Always understand the technology deeply first
- ❌ Don't create generic solutions - Always specialize for the specific use case
- ❌ Don't ignore validation - Every step must include verification
- ❌ Don't assume knowledge - Document everything explicitly
- ❌ Don't skip examples - Always include working code examples
- ❌ Don't forget edge cases - Include error handling and gotchas
- ❌ Don't add comments - Follow Clean Code patterns to avoid commenting your code, use good namings for functions, variables, etc

## 🔧 Tool Usage Standards

- **Use web search extensively** for research and documentation
- **Follow established command patterns** for slash commands
- **Use validation loops** to ensure quality at each step

These global rules apply regardless of whether you're generating templates, implementing features, or doing research. They form the foundation of effective work.
